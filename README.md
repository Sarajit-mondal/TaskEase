# Task Management App

A simple, responsive task management application built with React and TypeScript. This app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, filter and sort tasks by priority, and save tasks in `localStorage` to persist them across sessions. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is used for smooth, engaging animations.

## Features

- **Add, View, and Delete Tasks**: Create tasks with titles, descriptions, and priorities. View tasks in a structured layout, with options to delete tasks as needed.
- **Search & Sort**: Search tasks by title and sort by priority levels (Low, Medium, and High).
- **Task Persistence**: Stores tasks in `localStorage`, keeping them available even after a page refresh.
- **Smooth Animations**: GSAP powers animations, adding transitions for task addition, deletion, and selection.

## Screenshots
